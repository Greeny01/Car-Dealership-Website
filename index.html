                <p class="paral">The Lamborghini Urus is a luxury SUV manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer
                    Lamborghini. It was introduced in December 2017 as a 2018 model year production vehicle. The Urus is
                    the first Lamborghini SUV and five-door vehicle in the modern era (under the ownership of Volkswagen
                    Group), and the second SUV in the brand's history after the LM002, which was produced between 1986
                    and 1993. <br><br>

                    Built on the Volkswagen Group MLB Evo platform, the Urus shares many components with other
                    Volkswagen Group luxury SUVs, such as the Audi Q7, Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne, and Volkswagen
                    Touareg. With a top speed of 312 km/h (194 mph), the Urus SE is the fastest production SUV in the
                    world. <br><br>

                    The name comes from the urus, the ancestor of modern domestic cattle, also known as the aurochs</p>

            <!-- Mercedes Maybach GLS 600 Paragraph -->
            <p class="para-mercedes">The Mercedes-Benz GLS, formerly Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, is a full-size luxury
                crossover SUV produced by Mercedes-Benz since 2006. In each of its generations it is a three-row,
                seven-passenger vehicle positioned above the GLE (formerly Mercedes-Benz M-Class before 2016). The GLS
                is considered the flagship of the marque's SUV lineup, although the body-on-frame G-Class (originally
                intended for military off-roading but also offered in luxurious trims) is more expensive and has been in
                production longer. <br><br>

                From 2016 with the release of the facelifted second generation model, the GL-Class was renamed to GLS as
                per the revised nomenclature adopted by Mercedes. Under this scheme, SUVs use the base name "GL",
                followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "G" is for geländewagen (German for
                off-road vehicle) and alludes the long-running G-Class. This is followed by the letter "L" that acts as
                a linkage with the letter "S", the SUV equivalent to the S-Class, marketing the GLS as the corresponding
                SUV to the S-Class full-size sedan

            <!-- BMW X5 Paragraph -->
            <p class="para-bmw">The BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV produced by BMW. The X5 made its debut in
                1999 as the E53 model. It was BMW's first SUV. At launch, it featured all-wheel drive and was available
                with either a manual or automatic gearbox. The second generation was launched in 2006, and was known
                internally as the E70. The E70 featured the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to
                an automatic gearbox. In 2009, the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model. <br><br>

                BMW marketed the X5 officially as a "Sports Activity Vehicle" (SAV), rather than an SUV, to indicate its
                on-road handling capability despite its large dimensions.[4] The X5 signaled a shift away from the
                utilisation of body-on-frame construction, in favour of more modern monocoque chassis construction.
                Although the Mercedes-Benz M-Class was introduced more than a year prior to the X5, the X5 was the first
                to utilise a monocoque chassis. The M-Class used body-on-frame construction until its second generation.
